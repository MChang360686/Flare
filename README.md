# Flare
a random exercise in using switch and if else statements

This class uses the Java Random package to generate pseudorandom numbers between 1 and 3 depending on the integer value, the player and the computer will receive different flare colors.

Depending on the integer value, the if-else statements are used to actually check whether the int values are different or equal for both the player and the computer.  If both integers are the same, Flare will print "roll again" but if that is not the case then we are guaranteed a printout of either "Player goes first" or "Computer goes first".

This project was meant to be a way of deciding which player goes first, although a major flaw is that in the event of a tie there is currently no way to either re roll or break the tie.
